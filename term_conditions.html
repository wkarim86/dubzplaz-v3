                        <h2 class="page-para-heading-white">4. DUBZPLAY VIRTUAL ITEMS TERMS</h2>
                        <p>
                            Dubzplay may offer different types of digital content, credits, coins or other virtual items (e.g.: "a hair-cut") for which you may (a) purchase a limited license to use via the Services ("<b>Dubz Coins</b>" or "<b>Virtual Items</b>") or (b) earn or otherwise receive a limited license to use via the Services. You understand that while you may "earn" "buy" or "purchase" Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally "own" the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.
                        </p>
                    <ol class="l-alpha">
                        <li>Payment and Billing. Your purchase of Virtual Items through platforms such as the Apple Pay, App Store, Google Play, Amazon Games or Facebook is subject to those platforms’ payment terms and conditions and Dubzplay is not a party to the transaction. Dubzplay does not control how you can pay or how any refunds may be issued on those platforms. Please review those platforms’ terms of service for additional information. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you use to purchase Virtual Items. You authorize the applicable platform to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your order may be suspended or cancelled. You must resolve any problem encountered in order to proceed with your order. When you acquire a limited license to use Virtual Items from our Services, we and/or the platform may send you an acknowledgment email that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the acknowledgement message are correct as soon as possible and keep a copy of it for your records.</li>
                        
                        <li>Third-Party Sales. Dubzplay does not authorize, and expressly prohibits, the purchase of Virtual Items from third parties. You will not offer to sell or purchase Virtual Items to or from other users or third parties, and not sell or purchase Virtual Items to or from third parties. In addition to violating these Terms, these resale purchase transactions may be fraudulent or may lead to identity theft. Dubzplay is not responsible for any such transactions or any damages or harm that you might incur if you engage in transactions involving Virtual Items with other users or third parties.</li>
                        <li>Pricing and Taxes. All prices for Virtual Items are shown in US Dollars do not include applicable taxes and other charges, unless we state otherwise. Prices for Virtual Items are subject to change at any time, but changes will not affect any order you have already placed. You are responsible for any sales, use, value-added or other governmental taxes, fees or duties due with respect to your order. We may collect applicable taxes if we determine we have a duty to collect taxes.</li>
                        <li>Subscriptions. We may offer different subscription plans for purchasing Virtual Items (each, a "Subscription"). WHEN YOU PURCHASE A SUBSCRIPTION,
                            <ol class="l-roman">
                                <li>YOU AUTHORIZE THE PLATFORM YOU USE TO ACQUIRE THE VIRTUAL ITEMS, SUCH AS APPLE APP STORE, GOOGLE PLAY, TO CHARGE YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD FOR THE PERIOD (E.G., MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY) SPECIFIED IN YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AS LONG AS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION CONTINUES, AND</li>
                                <li>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS CONTINUOUS UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES OR PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <p>The Subscription period (or an indication that the Subscription will continue until cancelled), how to cancel your subscription, the cost of the Subscription you purchase and any other material terms are disclosed prior to purchase and may be confirmed via email by Dubzplay and/or the platform.</p> 
                        
                 <li>Cancelling Subscriptions. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME THROUGH THE TOOLS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE APPLICABLE PLATFORM (SUCH AS APPLE APP STORE, GOOGLE PLAY,). SUBSCRIPTIONS MUST BE CANCELLED BEFORE THE BILLING OR RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AFTER THE APPLICABLE BILLING OR RENEWAL DATE, IT WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CHARGES (INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) INCURRED WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBSCRIPTION ORDER PROCESSED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF YOUR CANCELLATION.</li>
                 <li>Redemption. Virtual Items may be redeemed solely by Dubzplay for goods or services made available through our Services. You may redeem Virtual Items only by the method and within the scope described via the Services.</li>
                 <li>Restrictions. All sales of Virtual Items are final, and Virtual Items are non-returnable and non-refundable. We may limit the number of Virtual Items you can purchase or use within certain periods of time or implement other restrictions on the receipt or use of Virtual Items. We may further restrict your ability to redeem your Virtual Items based on your place of residence. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DUBZPLAY IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH A PLATFORM, SUCH AS APPLE APP STORE, GOOGLE PLAY, AMAZON GAMES OR FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.</li>
                 <li>Errors. In the event of an error, we reserve the right to correct such error and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged.
                    <ol class="l-roman">
                        <li>Inactivity. While the Virtual Items you purchase do not expire, if you do not log into your account for a period of at least 2 years, if you deactivate your account, or if we have been unable to reach you to verify that you intend to continue using your account, then you authorize us, without further notice to you, to distribute Virtual Items in your account to other users as gifts or to redeem all Virtual Items remaining in your account for any content or items we select and to distribute or provide access to that content or items to other users as gifts.</li>
